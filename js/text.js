  Happy 3th Month Janna!! It's been such a fun journey with you so far, and I wanted you to know how much I value the time we spent together!
  I would say sana that it's been so fun looking back at the memories we had this month, pero since hell week maybe let's not think about it
  that much HAHAHA pero I'm glad still nasamahan kita! I always wanted to support you at your worst, and even though I have a lot to learn
  sa ganun, I'm happy na natulungan kita in the way that you needed! Let's work together ah? Alam ko naman na kaya naten 'to, basta head-strong
  and willing, we can achieve anything!

  Honestly, being with you feels like every day is a new adventure.
  Kahit nanonood lang or just chatting, or studying or what...
  I love how we can be goofy and serious at the same time, and it feels like I can always be myself with you:)
  It's like... emotional multitasking HAHAHA PERO for real, I'm so grateful to have you by my side.
  You've been such a positive light in my life, and I couldn't ask for a better partner in crime.

  Let's take our time, okay? And let's be honest and transparent with each other:) Just knowing na safe ka
  lagi, and happy ka with me is enough, Boccy ko. I really really did miss you during hell week, and ngayon tapos na yun, there are many more
  challenges along the way. Pero I believe light work, cuz we're BOCCY AND BOTEP. POWER TEAM, WE CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING! I hope enjoy mo yung gift na
  to, and let's look back at the pictures we sent each other, because I certainly do! Happy 3th month uli babe ko, and let's make the most of this month!
  Thanks for being you Janna, and for sticking around despite me being weird. Looking forward to our next adventure!
